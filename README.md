coronavirus-covid-19-SARS-CoV-2

All the IoC's I have gathered which are used directly in coronavirus / covid-19 / SARS-CoV-2 cyber attack campaigns. All IOC's are provided "as-is", please use your own verification methodology before deploying them in production network.

Remember, architecture is the base and everything else is an additional layer. Stronger your systems security architecture, lesser the possiblity of undesired incidents.

APT36 has been known to use this pandemic to target. These have been include in the list.

DO NOT CLICK  ON ANY URLs or VISIT IP Addresses, their current state is unknown and I have NOT masked (defaneg) all the URLs.

###  WHO has a WhatApp group for up-to-date information: http://bit.ly/who-covid19-whatsapp. Send a "hi" message to get started. 

Wishing everyone good health.
